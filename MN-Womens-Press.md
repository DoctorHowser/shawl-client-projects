## Overview & Story
MN Womens Press was founded in 1985, and has become a free monthly magazine with 20k per Month published. 
They Focus on Narrative, 1st person stories cenered around themes for a month. This months theme is 'Mentorship' for example. 

## Opportunity
Women's Press needs a better tool to help them collaborate with both their staff and the public on identify and producing the compelling stories of women in Minnesota. 
Their existing Filemaker database is clunky and is often ill-used because it lacks links to Google Docs and other collaborative workspaces where much of the work of their journalism happens.


The desired solution is a story "inbox" and database that would collect ideas from staff and the public for general story ideas as well as specific submissions for "special issues" around change-makers and other collections. 
This inbox would be processed by editorial staff and ideas could be selected for inclusion in the database and tagged with themes and subjects (including editorial themes bound to specific issues of the publication).
Stories in the database can include links to external resources like Google Docs as well as be associated with subject/contacts that would be sources or otherwise involved in the production of the story.

Developers tackling this project will have an opportunity to do some solution engineering around other features that could be useful for the editorial staff as they intake ideas 
(e.g. a start rating or other method to ID great ideas that don't fit into the immediate editorial calendar openings).

The story database will be searchable by keywords or themes and would allow for contacts/sources to be crosslisted to see which stories they've supported in the past.
