## Overview & Story

Communication between citizens and local goverment is important but cumbersome. 
Communication back and forth is almost non-existant, and it leads to people not beliving in their local government.

Things like potholes, graffitti, broken glass, loose dogs, go unreported and then never are fixed.


## Opportunity
Minneapolis has the 311 system to help notify city officials and departments. Ian wants to be able to do something similar, but with any municipality.

He wants to have a ticketing app where citizens can report issues. Using a map, taking pictures to help inform the municipality.
An admin/city worker can look at the tickets and dispatch appropriate resources and communicate back to citizens who requested help.

The worable prototype is mobile first for citizens, desktop for admins. Has Figma stuff, wireframes started.
