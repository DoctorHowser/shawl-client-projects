## Overview & Story
Maxine is a relativly new gamer. She likes certain games, but isnt privy to what genres and flavors of games mean, and gets frustrated when she buys a game for $70 only to not like it.

## Opportunity
Steam, and other platforms reccomend games based on other games you've bought. This is problematic, since not everything you buy you like.
She wants to develop an algorythm based on playtime of games, to reccommend in a weighted way what you may like. 

The basic formula is (hours played of game) / (total hours played). Using some sort of weight and tags, to get games better reccommended.

Kinda like goodreads for videogames. Using the Steam API.

## NOTE
This is a fairly open project -- not a lot of definition from the client, so this will require some more design and thought and decision making as to what makes sense.
